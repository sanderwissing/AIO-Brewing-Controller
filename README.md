# AIO-Brewing-Controller
Replacement PID brewing controller with touch screen for Digiboil

This python project is based around a ESP32-4848S040, which has a 4 inch square 
touch screen wtih 480 x 480 resolution.  It implements a PID brewing controller 
for an AIO system with electric heating and a pump.

I am using this to add PID to a digiboil system, so not using the pump functionality
for now, although I may add an integrated pump later.

This is early days in the development while I am waiting for hardware to arrive.
